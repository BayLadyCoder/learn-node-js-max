Models

- Responsible for representing your data
- Responsible for managing your data (saving, fetching, ...)
- Doesn't matter if you manage data in memory, files, or databases

Views

- What the users see
- Shouldn't contain too much logic (Handlebars!)

Controllers

- Connect models and views
- Should only make sure that the two can communicate (in both directions)
